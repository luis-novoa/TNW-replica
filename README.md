This project's goal was to replicate [The Next Web Website](https://thenextweb.com/), with an aim on making the replica responsive as proposed by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/building-with-responsive-design). This is part of the Microverse curriculum. [Here](https://raw.githack.com/luis-novoa/tnw-replica/dev/index.html) you can check how the page looks like right now.

# Workflow

1 - Create the github repository.

2 - Create a branch to work on (never code in the master branch).

3 - Take printscreens of the website pn it's different breakpoints.

4 - Draw the containers and plan the breakpoints on top of the printscreens. (files can be found in the Plan folder in the repo)

5 - Write the HTML structure of the page.

6 - Style the page from top to bottom using CSS, creating sections corresponding to the main elements of the page and respecting the order in which the labels are presented in HTML.

7- Use Adobe Photoshop, reize images and add yellow corners (when applicable).

8- Design the search icon (in both clear and dark versions) using Adobe Illustrator.

9 - Save your progress constantly on github. This ensures plenty of returning points in case they are needed.

10 - After finishing the project, send the HTML and CSS files to an online file validators.
